This project was made using Vite, Typescript, and React. The user is able to search for recipes by listing ingredients in a comma separated list and filtering by vegetarian and gluten-free. Recipes are fetched from the Spoonacular API based on the chosen criteria. Each recipe is then expandable to show the ingredient list, cooking instructions, and nutrition information.
